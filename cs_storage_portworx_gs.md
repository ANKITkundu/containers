# Getting started with Portworx
{: #getting-started-with-portworx}

Review the following information to verify your Portworx installation and get started with adding highly available local persistent storage to your containerized apps.
{: shortdesc}

- [Verifying your Portworx installation](#px-verify-installation)
- [Creating a Portworx volume](#px-add-storage)
- [Mounting the volume to your app](#px-mount-pvc)

## Verifying your Portworx installation
{: #px-verify-installation}

Verify that your Portworx installation completed successfully and that all your local disks were recognized and added to the Portworx storage layer.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin:
- Make sure that you [installed the latest version of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} CLI plug-in](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_upgrade).
- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To verify your installation:

1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources), find the Portworx service that you created.
2. Review the **Status** column to see if the installation succeeded or failed. The status might take a few minutes to update.
3. If the **Status** changes to `Provision failure`, follow the [instructions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_storage#debug-portworx) to start troubleshooting why your installation failed.
4. If the **Status** changes to `Provisioned`, verify that your Portworx installation completed successfully and that all your local disks were recognized and added to the Portworx storage layer.
   1. List the Portworx pods in the `kube-system` namespace. The installation is successful when you see one or more `portworx`, `stork`, and `stork-scheduler` pods. The number of pods equals the number of worker nodes that are included in your Portworx cluster. All pods must be in a `Running` state.
      ```
      kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep 'portworx\|stork'
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      portworx-594rw                          1/1       Running     0          20h

      ```
      {: screen}

   2. Log in to one of your `portworx` pods and list the status of your Portworx cluster.
      ```
      kubectl exec <portworx_pod> -it -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```

      ```
      {: screen}

   3. Verify that all worker nodes that you wanted to include in your Portworx storage layer are included by reviewing the **StorageNode** column in the **Cluster Summary** section of your CLI output. Worker nodes that are included in the storage layer are displayed with `Yes` in the **StorageNode** column.

      Because Portworx runs as a daemon set in your cluster, new worker nodes that you add to your cluster are automatically inspected for raw block storage and added to the Portworx data layer.
      {: note}

   4. Verify that each storage node is listed with the correct amount of raw block storage by reviewing the **Capacity** column in the **Cluster Summary** section of your CLI output.

   5. Review the Portworx I/O classification that was assigned to the disks that are part of the Portworx cluster. During the setup of your Portworx cluster, every disk is inspected to determine the performance profile of the device. The profile classification depends on how fast the network is that your worker node is connected to and the type of storage device that you have. Disks of SDS worker nodes are classified as `high`. If you manually attach disks to a virtual worker node, then these disks are classified as `low` due to the lower network speed that comes with virtual worker nodes.
      ```
      kubectl exec -it <portworx_pod> -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cluster provision-status
      ```
      {: pre}

## Creating a Portworx volume
{: #px-add-storage}

Start creating Portworx volumes by using [Kubernetes dynamic provisioning](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#dynamic_provisioning).
{: shortdesc}

1. List available storage classes in your cluster and check whether you can use an existing Portworx storage class that was set up during the Portworx installation. The pre-defined storage classes are optimized for database usage and to share data across pods.
   ```
   kubectl get storageclasses | grep portworx
   ```
   {: pre}

   To view the details of a storage class, run `kubectl describe storageclass <storageclass_name>`.
   {: tip}

2. If you don't want to use an existing storage class, create a customized storage class. For a full list of supported options that you can specify in your storage class, see [Using Dynamic Provisioning](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-pvcs/dynamic-provisioning/#using-dynamic-provisioning){: external}.
   1. Create a configuration file for your storage class.
      ```yaml
      kind: StorageClass
      apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
      metadata:
        name: <storageclass_name>
      provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
      parameters:
        repl: "<replication_factor>"
        secure: "<true_or_false>"
        priority_io: "<io_priority>"
        shared: "<true_or_false>"
      ```
      {: codeblock}

      <tr>
      <td><code>parameters.repl</code></td>
      <td>Enter the number of replicas for your data that you want to store across different worker nodes. Allowed numbers are `1`,`2`, or `3`. For example, if you enter `3`, then your data is replicated across three different worker nodes in your Portworx cluster. To store your data highly available, use a multizone cluster and replicate your data across three worker nodes in different zones. <strong>Note: </strong>You must have enough worker nodes to fulfill your replication requirement. For example, if you have two worker nodes, but you specify three replicas, then the creation of the PVC with this storage class fails. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

Choose between the following options: <ul><li><strong>true</strong>: Enter <code>true</code> to enable encryption for your Portworx volumes. To encrypt volumes, you must have an {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong_notm}} service instance and a Kubernetes secret that holds your customer root key. For more information about how to set up encryption for Portworx volumes, see [Encrypting your Portworx volumes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-portworx#encrypt_volumes). </li><li><strong>false</strong>: When you enter <code>false</code>, your Portworx volumes are not encrypted. </li></ul> If you do not specify this option, your Portworx volumes are not encrypted by default. <strong>Note:</strong> You can choose to enable volume encryption in your PVC, even if you disabled encryption in your storage class. The setting that you make in the PVC take precedence over the settings in the storage class.  </td>

Your data is replicated across both high and low speed disks. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><code>parameters.shared</code></td>
      <td>Define whether you want to allow multiple pods to access the same volume.

If your pod is deployed onto a different worker node, the pod cannot access the volume.</li></ul></td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>

   2. Create the storage class.
      ```
      kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Verify that the storage class is created.
      ```
      kubectl get storageclasses
      ```
      {: pre}

2. Create a persistent volume claim (PVC).
   1. Create a configuration file for your PVC.
      ```yaml
      kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      apiVersion: v1
      metadata:
        name: mypvc
      spec:

      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><code>spec.accessModes</code></td>
      <td>Enter the [Kubernetes access mode ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) that you want to use. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><code>resources.requests.storage</code></td>
      <td>Enter the amount of storage in gigabytes that you want to assign from your Portworx cluster. For example, to assign 2 gigabytes from your Portworx cluster, enter `2Gi`. The amount of storage that you can specify is limited by the amount of storage that is available in your Portworx cluster. If you specified a replication factor in your storage class that is higher than 1, then the amount of storage that you specify in your PVC is reserved on multiple worker nodes.   </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><code>spec.storageClassName</code></td>
      <td>Enter the name of the storage class that you chose or created earlier and that you want to use to provision your PV. The example YAML file uses the <code>portworx-shared-sc</code> storage class. </td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>

   2. Create your PVC.
      ```
      kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Verify that your PVC is created and bound to a persistent volume (PV). This process might take a few minutes.
      ```
      kubectl get pvc
      ```
      {: pre}

## Mounting the volume to your app
{: #px-mount-pvc}

To access the storage from your app, you must mount the PVC to your app.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a configuration file for a deployment that mounts the PVC.
